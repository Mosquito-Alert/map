The models estimate the probability of at least one valid report being sent through Mosquito Alert from each area during a given month. These estimates are based on statistical models that account for a number of different environmental and social variables, including weather, land cover, and participants’ sampling effort. This last variable is important because we want to know whether low reporting from a given place reflects low numbers of the given target species’ or simply low numbers of citizen scientists participating at that point. Model estimates are made holding sampling effort constant, meaning that we are estimating the probability we would expect to see if Mosquito Alert participants were all putting the same effort into searching for and reporting target species at all times and places. We limit estimates of the target mosquito species to those areas in which the species has already been confirmed as present by the ECDC and/or Mosquito Alert (see the distribution maps).",

You can also choose the color palette that you like best.",

By visualizing observations submitted through the Mosquito Alert platform, the map offers timely insights that complement official surveillance efforts and contribute to the early detection of mosquito-borne disease risks.\\n\\nIn Europe, the map uses official data from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) at the NUTS3 level as a reference framework. In Spain, municipal-level data from the Center for Coordination of Health Alerts and Emergencies (CCAES) serves as the benchmark for this analysis. These authoritative sources provide a foundation against which citizen-reported discoveries can be compared.\\n\\nThe map’s legend clearly distinguishes between two types of data: yellow areas (indicate regions with officially recognized mosquito presence) and red areas (highlight locations where Mosquito Alert participants have reported mosquito species that are not yet reflected in official records).\\n\\nBy spotlighting these community-driven discoveries, the map reveals potential gaps in surveillance and underscores the value of real-time, ground-level data. It empowers citizens, researchers, and public health officials to work together in identifying emerging risks, informing response strategies, and refining monitoring systems.\\n\\nThe Mosquito Alert Discovery Map exemplifies how open, participatory science can enhance public health infrastructure and foster a shared responsibility in managing vector-borne disease threats.",
